# Swift Enhancements for JetBrains appCode IDE
This projet is just in the experimental stages. I want to see if I can enhance the Swift support in the appCode IDE. There are currently very few features, but they are slowly being added.


### Features:
1. Syntax Highlighting Enhancements For Optionals and Optional Operators
2. Variable Read/Write Highlighting
3. Remove Uneeded Parenthesis Intention
